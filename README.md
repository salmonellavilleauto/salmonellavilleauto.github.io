salmonellavilleauto.github.io
=============================

This is a simple set of pages for testing integrations with the Yammer platform, including Login, Embed, and the JavaScript SDK. It's meant to provide an environment that is mostly representative of an actual third party integration.

## Usage
Just go to http://salmonellavilleauto.github.io/

## Setup
You need the following to make sure this page works for you.

* You need to be a member of the Salmonellaville network **on the staging site**, not production.
* You need to be a member of the test network created with the domain freeyamnetwork.com.

Ask someone in QA to invite you to these.

## Troubleshooting
If you've done the above, but you get weird errors, it's probably because you're logged into Yammer staging with the wrong account. The freeyamnetwork.com network is separate from your normal staging network account. Log out of the staging network and log back in with the freeyamnetwork.com account. Or use a private tab in your browser.
